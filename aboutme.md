<!-- # **About Me** -->

Hi I am **{{ site.author }}** :wave:,<br>
I’m a technology enthusiast who takes joy in challenging new heights and exploring the boundless possibilities. Working with leading tech companies like IBM, Robert Bosch and State Street Corporation in an array of roles, kept my burning passion for IT going. The exponential increase of new technologies while daunting excites me greatly. Fidgeting with stuff is my forte, mastering them is my goal.

My journey began with IBM, where I have got solid experience in Unix Shell Scripting, Java, SQL, DB2. Next, in Robert Bosch, I developed several dashboard applications and automation tool frameworks for Data Analysis and ETL tasks, using Python, VBA macros, Unix Shell Scripting, and SQL. 

In near future, a new class of smart companies will emerge, where AI will be the prime functionality of the business. I believe that the best way to predict the future is to make one. With this belief, I headed to pursue my Masters from Rutgers University. Right from day one, I was a curious ninja, tumbling to learn as much as I can about AI. I gained in-depth knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, Computer vision - CNN, NLP – RNN through the intense curriculum and online courses. 

As a result, I landed myself in a Summer Internship with State Street Corporation where I have been working in various real-world Machine Learning applications and Software Development using Python, Deep Learning Frameworks, Hadoop components, Full Stack – ReactJS Front end, Flask middleware and HDFS backend.
